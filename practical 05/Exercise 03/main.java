//The provided code has some syntax errors and incomplete methods. I'll correct the code and explain the outcome.

Class 01: `Student`
```java
final class Student {
    final int marks = 100;

    final void display() {
        System.out.println("Marks: " + marks);
    }
}


Class 02: `Undergraduate` (a subclass of `Student`)
```java
class Undergraduate extends Student {
    // Subclass can inherit from a final class, but the subclass itself cannot be final.
    // If you add "final" here, it will result in a compilation error.
}

//Outcome and Explanation:
//1. `Student` class: The `Student` class is marked as `final`, which means it cannot be subclassed (i.e., cannot have any subclasses). 
//The `marks` variable is marked as `final`, making it a constant value with an initial value of 100. 
//The `display` method is marked as `final`, indicating that it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.

//2. `Undergraduate` class: The `Undergraduate` class is an attempt to subclass the `Student` class, but it doesn't include the `final` keyword, which is correct. 
//A subclass can inherit from a final class, but the subclass itself cannot be final. 
//If you add the `final` keyword before `class Undergraduate`, it will result in a compilation error because you are trying to subclass a final class, 
//which is not allowed.
//The code will compile successfully without any errors. The output will be:

//Marks: 100

//When you create an object of the `Undergraduate` class and call the `display` method, it will print the value of the `marks` variable, which is 100. 
//Since the `display` method is marked as `final`, it cannot be overridden in the `Undergraduate` class, and the implementation from the `Student` class will be used.
